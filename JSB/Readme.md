Still seem to be some major instabilities.<br/>
After removing a lot of micro-network managing codes,<br/>
the TCN network is still capable of reaching LSTM like performance<br/>
at 8.41<br/>
but my own modified code was unable to replicate the 8.1 status. <br/>
Still, the amount gain in computational efficiency is significant.
